Day 1: Arrival + Central Sights (Light Exploration)
Arrival at 1 PM – head to your accommodation, check in by ~3 PM.
Myeongdong – Explore skincare shops, street food, and the bustling pedestrian street.
Optional evening walk to N Seoul Tower (via cable car or hike from Myeongdong) – for night views of the city.
Why? Myeongdong is close to most central accommodations and N Seoul Tower is nearby.

Day 2: Traditional & Market
Morning: Gyeongbokgung Palace (arrive by 9 AM to catch the changing of the guard).
Afternoon: Seochon or Bukchon Hanok Village (optional detour).
Late Afternoon: Gwangjang Market – street food and vintage shopping.
Evening: picnic at Hanggang + Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) + shopping (some malls open late).
Why? These places are all in the central/northern part of Seoul and easily done together.

Day 3: Everland Day Trip
Full Day: Everland Theme Park (start early; ~1.5 hrs travel each way).
Return to Seoul around 8–9 PM. Light evening snack near your stay.
Why? Everland is a day-trip destination and needs a dedicated day due to distance.

Day 4: Hip & Trendy Neighborhoods
Morning-Afternoon: Seongsu (cafés, galleries, Adidas flagship, handmade shops).
Late Afternoon: Gangnam (COEX Mall, K-Star Road).
Evening: Chill in a rooftop bar or spa (like in Sinsa or Apgujeong).
Why? Both areas are in the southern part of Seoul; combining them reduces backtracking.

Day 5: Youth & Vibes (Departure Day)
Morning-Afternoon: Hongdae – street art, indie cafés, shopping, university culture.
Leave for airport by 3 PM (assuming you need to be there by 4 PM).
Why? Hongdae is close to AREX train to the airport and offers a relaxed final day.
